My hometown is sorely lacking in accessible recreational social spaces for teenagers. There wasn’t really anywhere that was appropriate to just hang out, and with no public transit there would be no way to get there unless you both had a driver’s license and were able to borrow your parents’ car at that time. The one maybe-acceptable social space was the local library, but I was unfortunate enough to not go to the one middle school within walking distance of it, and I happened to work there anyway so it wasn’t really a place for leisure as much as it was shelving books. In retrospect, adults in that town don’t have it much easier — it’s hard to go out to a bar when you have to drive yourself home.

But how then, did I socialize growing up outside of school and scheduled college-resume-building activities? The answer was online chat rooms. While the proportion of my social time spent in chat rooms has decreased somewhat as I’ve gotten older, the online spaces I “inhabited” were essential to my social development and leisure during my teenage years.

When I later learned about the concept of “third places”, I immediately understood the problem with my hometown, and why an otherwise spacious and comfortable home ended up feeling like a prison at times. It also led to an interesting question: were the online chatrooms and video games I played also “third places”, and do they count as “metaverses”?

### What is a third place?

A third place, as originally defined in Ray Oldenburg’s The Great Good Place, “is a generic designation for a great variety of public places that host the regular, voluntary, informal, and happily anticipated gatherings of individuals beyond the realms of home and work,” in contrast to the home as the “first place” and the workplace as the “second place”.</sup>1^ The presence of abundant third places in one’s neighborhood is associated with high perceived quality of life^2^ and psychological benefits such as reduced stress and improved mood.^3^

Oldenburg continues to define eight common characteristics of a third place:

1. Is on neutral ground: Oldenburg defines this as “where individuals may come and go as they please, in which none are required to play host, and in which all feel at home and comfortable.”^4^. Point being, it can’t be someone else’s home either.
2. Is a leveler: a term borrowed from English history, referring to the abolition of social hierarchical rank. Third places thus must be inclusive and not exclusive, nor require a certain social status to take part. While inside, that concept of rank does not exist.
3. Conversation is the main activity there: Fairly self-explanatory; some form of socialization must be the first activity of the space.
4. Is accessible and accommodating: Third places should be those that one can visit at any time of day and be able to find acquaintances there, and be easy to get to physically.
5. Has regulars: Self-explanatory. Talking to regulars are often what brings people back.
6. Has a low profile: Third places typically have an unassuming appearance and aren’t necessarily advertised much. This reduces the number of strangers who pass through, and helps cement the place as part of a daily routine rather than a special occasion.
7. Has a playful mood: Or in more modern parlance, it should have good vibes. A place for leisure should be pleasant to inhabit, not dour or serious. The vibe might be more subtle, but it’s essential for the character of the space.
8. Is a “home away from home”: This one is hard to describe succinctly. Oldenburg leans on a five-part definition by David Seamon to describe this: A third place is a place that centers one’s comings and goings, to which its regulars feel a sense of ownership over and belonging to, restores the individual in spirit, puts its inhabitants at ease, and has a sense of community warmth.

Examples of archetypical third places include English pubs or French coffeehouses. Notably these kinds of places are fairly absent from life in the United States, and Oldenburg attributes at-the-time growing issues with social isolation, boredom, and loneliness with the absense of these places in the typical American lifestyle.^5^

### Metaverses as third places
As it turns out, “metaverses” are not only effective third places but there is academic research on the subject dating back nearly 20 years.^a^ A study of the games Lineage and Asheron’s Call from 2006 found that MMOs satisfy nearly all eight of Oldenburg’s criteria for third places, with the sole outlier being accessibility due to the need for a powerful computer and subscription to play.^6^ In the years since, the issue of price and device as barriers has been rendered moot: games such as Fortnite, which is both free-to-play and available on mobile phones;^7^ and Final Fantasy XIV, which has a generous free trial, seem to be serving as effective third spaces for the next generation of gamers.^8^

For a more personal example, the competitive shooter games Call of Duty and Rainbow Six Siege were extremely popular amongst the non-gamer high school boys of my hometown when I grew up. That town has very large residences spaced far apart, few to no sidewalks, and few public spaces for leisure — in short, no third spaces, and no good way to get to any third spaces further away when you’re too young to drive. As a result, playing either of those two games with voice chat became a primary avenue for social activity for my classmates. Extending the concept of their multiplayer lobby to a “space” reveals that, minus the entry fee of buying a console, these games were functioning as third spaces similarly to how the previous MMO examples did for their players.

### Third places with regards to VR and AR
Notably, I have yet to mention VR or AR technology with regards metaverses to third places. This is because, currently, these technologies have a financial barrier similar to those of MMOs in 2006 that impede them from being used widely for online third places. The Meta Quest 3S is considered one of the best budget options as of time of writing, and that will still set you back $300.^9^ That’s not to say that immersive technology prevents a third place from forming — online VR-centric game VRChat^10 11^ is being used as a third place now, and Bigscreen^12^ was explicitly created as one — but the price of headsets will have to come down or for VR-centric spaces to allow non-VR access in order to see better accessibility more in line with Oldenburg’s definition.

That being said, I don’t believe immersive technology to be as essential to the concept of a metaverse. A literature review I found aiming to define the often-nebulous term came away with:

> “Metaverse, a crossword of “meta” (meaning transcendency) and “universe”, describes a (decentralized) three-dimensional online environment that is persistent and immersive, in which users represented by avatars can participate socially and economically with each other in a creative and collaborative manner in virtual spaces decoupled from the real physical world.”^13^ 

While the authors acknowledge that the importance of VR technology is still up in the air, find the fact that it is absent from their current definition suggests that it’s not an essential component. Interestingly, some of Oldenburg’s third place characteristics can also be seen in this definition: “persistent” can be thought of as accessibility in time and place, “decentralized” can refer to neutral ground, and “participat[ing] socially” suggests that conversation is the main activity.

I do have some gripes with this definition: some of the MMOs examined in the aforementioned 2006 study were 2D, and would fail this definition exclusively for that reason. I don’t believe the concept of “space” needs to rigidly be in a 3D environment to be immersive; for example, 2D, offline games such as Hollow Knight: Silksong have been described as “immersive” by reviewers,^14^ and having played it myself I don’t believe that to be an inaccurate descriptor.

### Is a chat room a metaverse or a third space?
If immersive technology is not mandatory for a “metaverse”, let alone a third space, let’s analyze an online chatroom similar to one I would’ve used in high school to see if it’s a third space:

1. On neutral ground: ✅. The rooms were fully open and didn’t require a host.
2. A leveler: ✅. Our relative wealth or status was not relevant in the chat room.
3. Conversation is the main activity: ✅. It’s pretty much the only activity.
4. Accessible and accommodating: ✅. Requires only a free account and is always available. Chat history also allows asynchronous discussions.
5. Has regulars: ✅. Every chat room I’ve been in has regulars.
6. A low profile: ✅. Chat rooms are generally unglamorous, even less so than MMOs.
7. A playful mood: ✅. I wouldn’t call the typical chat room serious business. I’ve seen a few specifically serious channels for management of large projects or moderation, but that’s for specific tasks and not the main activity.
8. Is a home away from home: ✅. I at least felt so. I’ve seen other users with strong attachments to their communities too and express that openly.

As a result of this examination, I can confidently say that online chat rooms are certainly third spaces, as they easily meet all eight of Oldenburg’s criteria. They don’t count as “metaverses”, since a customizable profile picture isn’t much of an “avatar” nor is there any sense of 2D or 3D space, but that has not procluded them from being third spaces.

Reflecting on this, as excited as I am for better virtual worlds and VR, I’m wondering if it’s all necessary. The main, primal, need for us social creatures is the community a third place provides, and the chat room demonstrates that a third space need not be an immersive world with an avatar to serve that purpose. Perhaps that need for community over immersion is why Meta Horizons failed to gain traction. I did not, however, examine the relative quality of third spaces in this exploration, so that might be a future idea to explore: are immersive online third spaces more effective than non-immersive?
