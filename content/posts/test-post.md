### Code Snippets

Here is some `inline code`.

~~Jekyll~~ Hugo also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```


### Lists

Here is an unordered list:

* Alpha
  * Alphas have red eyes.
* Beta
* Gamma
* Delta
  * Delta species have different types.

And here is an ordered list:

1. First!
2. Second.
3. Third...

Pretty neat, don't you think?
